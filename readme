This project implements the paper "An analytical approach for NoC performance Analysis" by
Umit Y. Orgas, Radu Marculecu et. al published in IEEE/TCAD in december 2010 for the contention modeling 

and 

A.  E.  Kiasari,  Z.  Lu,  and  A.  Jantsch,  “An  analytical  latency  model  fornetworks-on-chip”,IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI)Systems, vol. 21, pp. 113–123, 1 Jan. 2013 for the congestion modeling


This is an analytical model for latency prediction in NoCs


Compilation:
In general, programs which use Armadillo are compiled along these lines:
  g++ example1.cpp -o example1 -O2 -larmadillo

(you may also need to specify the include directory via the -I switch)

If you get linking errors, or if Armadillo was installed manually
and you specified that LAPACK and BLAS are available, you will
need to explicitly link with LAPACK and BLAS (or their equivalents),
for example:
  g++ example1.cpp -o example1 -O2 -llapack -lblas

(you may also need to specify the library directory via the -L switch)

If you have specified that ARPACK (or its equivalent) is available,
add -larpack to the compiler command line.  For example:
  g++ example1.cpp -o example1 -O2 -llapack -lblas -larpack
